1. What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic device that processes data and executes instructions to perform various tasks. It consists of both hardware (physical components like the CPU, memory, storage devices, etc.) and software (programs that instruct the computer on how to operate). Computers are capable of performing a wide range of activities, including calculations, data storage, communication, and running applications.

2. What is RAM?
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of volatile memory used by the computer to temporarily store data that is currently being processed or used. It allows quick read and write access by the CPU. When the computer is turned off, the data in RAM is lost. It helps improve the overall speed and performance of the computer by providing fast access to active data.

3. Where is data stored in a computer?
Data in a computer is stored in multiple locations:

Primary Storage (RAM): Temporarily stores data while the computer is on and running.
Secondary Storage: Includes devices like hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical discs, which store data long-term.
Cache Memory: A small amount of high-speed memory located near the CPU for storing frequently accessed data to improve performance.
4. What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system?
The input device used to type text and numbers is a keyboard. It consists of keys that represent letters, numbers, and special characters, allowing users to input data into the computer.

5. What are the output devices?
Output devices are hardware components that display or produce results from the computerâ€™s processing. Examples include:

Monitor: Displays visual output.
Printer: Produces physical copies (printed documents).
Speakers: Output sound.
Headphones: Output sound directly to the user.
6. Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?
The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is a mouse. Other devices like trackpads and touchscreens can also be used for this purpose.

7. Which language is directly understood by the computer without a translation program?
The language directly understood by the computer is machine language (or machine code). This language is composed of binary code (0s and 1s) and is the lowest-level language the computer can process without any translation.

8. What are Input devices?
Input devices are hardware components that allow users to provide data or commands to a computer. Examples include:

Keyboard: For typing text and numbers.
Mouse: For pointing, clicking, and selecting.
Scanner: For digitizing documents and images.
Microphone: For capturing audio.
Webcam: For capturing images or videos.
Touchscreen: For interacting directly with the display by touching it.
